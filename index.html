    Once up on a time... I was born. I grabbed a circle block and shoved it into a square block.
    I then wanted the blue circle back, so I shaked the box, but the blue circle was stuck inside the box.
    Since there wasn't a circle spot on the box, it was on the other box.
    Knowing I couldn't get it, I cried.
    I never got the blue circle.
    I just did stuff in life like rowing. My dad was a game developer, so I was intruiged about his games.
    I like games, so I wanna make them for other people to like them aswell.
